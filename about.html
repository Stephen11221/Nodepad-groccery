                    <p>We started selling Grocceries back in may 12 <sup>th</sup> 2011 at a shop called Njimi Ngige. Our business started
                        booming day by day which was good. The website helped our customer to shop online instead of coming to
                        our stores.
                    </p>
                    <p> This made our work easy and we got new customer from all over the country. We created our customer care
                        group in June 1 <sup>rst</sup> 2012 because we had more customers from all over the country.
